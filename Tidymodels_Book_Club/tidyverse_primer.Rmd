This is the beginning of the tidymodels book club with R-Ladies RTP - June 2025. 
We are covering Tidy Modeling with R Version 1.0.0 (2023-09-06) - https://www.tmwr.org.

I am going to work through the book examples for the chapters as part of this project.

This is Chapter 2 - Tidyverse Primer. 

The data set comes from the city of Chicago’s data portal and contains daily ridership data for the city’s elevated train stations. The data set has columns for:

the station identifier (numeric)
the station name (character)
the date (character in mm/dd/yyyy format)
the day of the week (character)
the number of riders (numeric)

```{r, tidyverse syntax}

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

url <- "https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/5neh-572f/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&bom=true&format=true"

all_stations <- 
  # Step 1: Read in the data.
  read_csv(url) %>% 
  # Step 2: filter columns and rename stationname
  dplyr::select(station = stationname, date, rides) %>% 
  # Step 3: Convert the character date field to a date encoding.
  # Also, put the data in units of 1K rides
  mutate(date = mdy(date), rides = rides / 1000) %>% 
  # Step 4: Summarize the multiple records using the maximum.
  group_by(date, station) %>% 
  summarize(rides = max(rides), .groups = "drop")



```
